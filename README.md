# Project 3: Turing Machine Simulator

* Authors: Julia Melchert and Axel Murillo
* Class: CS361 Section 002
* Semester: Spring 2024

## Overview

This project uses Java to mimic a turing machine.

## Reflection

* What worked well and what was a struggle?

* What concepts still aren't quite clear?

* What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?

* What would you change about your design process?

* If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?


## Compiling and Using

In order to compile and run the test suite, use the following commands:
```
javac tm/TMSimulator.java tm/TMState.java
java tm/TMSimulator.java fileX.txt
```
where fileX.txt is the filename of the properly-formatted turing machine specifications (see file0.txt for an example).
